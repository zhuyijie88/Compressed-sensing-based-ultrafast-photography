# Compressed-sensing-based-ultrafast-photography
The full_experiment_code.m file contains six parts, which are called section 5.1, section 5.2, section 5.3, TwIST algorithm, IST algorithm and tvdenoising algorithm respectively. The first three parts simulate methods in chapter 5 of Compressed Sensing Based Ultrafast Photography. And the following three functions are the main steps of certain simulation/computation.
If you want to excute the given code, it's necessary to seprate the file into several subfiles, running in Matlab.
